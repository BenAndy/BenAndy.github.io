				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>What Did the Bomb do to Maralinga?</p>
				<p>Corrupted Maralinga with radiation poisoning which killed off animals, plantlife and even people. It also (of course) destroyed most of Maralinga.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>When Were The Bombs Used?</p>
				<p>The first bomb was used in October 1953 and the last one was detonated in 1963.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>When Might Maralinga be Cleared of Radiation?</p>
				<p>The particular type of material used at Maralinga was plutonium which the scientists thought would only last 50 years, but plutonium can have a nuclear fallour of 24,000 years meaning it is going to be a long time until it is safe to go to Maralinga</p>
