				<p id="sectionHeader">Who Was Responsible?</p>
				<p>British service man/government were responsible for the tragic event at Maralinga which took the lives of many innocent aboriginal people and left a sacred land in ruin.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>What Did the Bomb do to Maralinga?</p>
				<p>Corrupted Maralinga with radiation poisoning which killed off animals, plantlife and even people. It also (of course) destroyed most of Maralinga.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>When Were The Bombs Used?</p>
				<p>The first bomb was used in October 1953 and the last one was detonated in 1963.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>When Might Maralinga be Cleared of Radiation?</p>
				<p>The particular type of material used at Maralinga was plutonium which the scientists thought would only last 50 years, but plutonium can have a nuclear fallour of 24,000 years meaning it is going to be a long time until it is safe to go to Maralinga</p>

				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>How did the British Justify the Nuclear Tests?</p>
				<p>They thought that these tests would be for the better good for mankind to stop the world’s next great dictator or war and to do this some land must be sacrificed.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>Why do you Think they Chose that Particular Site for Their Testing?</p>
				<p>They chose Maralinga as their detonation site because there was no ‘civilised’ people living in the land and it was remote from the public’s view.</p>
				<p id="sectionHeader"><br>What was the Broader Reason for Wanting to Conduct Nuclear Tests?</p>
				<p>The broader reason for the nuclear tests was the arms war and cold war to be ahead of the rest of the world in weapons because whoever has more advanced weapons they essentially rule the world.</p>
