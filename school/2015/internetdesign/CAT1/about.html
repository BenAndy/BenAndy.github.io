      <br>Here you can find some more information on me! In my free time I like to do many things, you can see them <a href="hobbies.html">here</a>.
      <br><br>I was born on October 17<sup>th</sup>, 2000 in a town called Warrnambool. There I grew up meeting wonderful friends and learning how to do many things. I enjoy creating websites<sup>most of them having no point</sup>, Watching TV, playing games, eating, and talking to my friends is all something I enjoy to do!

        I enjoy watching YouTube in my free time - I'll end up spending hours upon hours watching silly little videos... It may seem like a waste of time but I like it, it keeps me entertained. I watch all kinds of videos, from gameplays to fail videos. For some reason I find humour in people flying fast first into the ground after having a really awkward trip.

      I learnt how to code HTML, JS, &amp; CSS out of pure curiosity. I now love making websites whether or not they have a point. It's just something I do for fun. In my spare time I'll make the most random things. Most of it is just to <i>explore</i> my coding skills. I sometimes I don't pay attention to detail and just work on things like JS. One thing I made, mainly with JavaScript (JS) can be seen <a href="http://benandy.github.io/dev/2/" target="_blank">HERE</a>. As you can see I've focused more on it's purpose then it's design.

      One of my all time favoutire movies would have to be 'The Interview'. It is a comedy movie based around a TV show known as 'Skylark Tonight'. They have organised an interview with Kim Jon Un, the leader of North Korea. Before they head off to North Korea they are told to assassinate Kim Jon Un. It may sound like a serious action movie, but trust me. It's a comedy.
