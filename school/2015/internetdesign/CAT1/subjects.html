      <br>Currently I am studying many subject at school. These include; Internet Design, The Great Outdoors, Maths, English, Science, Robotics, Graphic Design, &amp; History. My favourites would have to be The Great Outdoors, Robotics, &amp; Graphic Design. Information on my favourite three are below!
      <br><br><h2>The Great Outdoors</h2>The subject name basically explains it all. In this class we often will ride bikes around the streets, go swimming &amp; surfing at the beach, &amp; even sometimes we will go canoing down some rivers. I like this class becuase it can get me away from the school and I can go for rides &amp; have fun with my other freinds in that class.
      <br><br><h2>Robotics</h2>Robotics... <span title="Nah duh - It's kinda cool though.">Basically we make robots!</span> Most of the robots we make are made using Lego... Lots and lots of Lego. We get to program out robots to do what ever we want them to do. We can build them to our hearts desire &amp; create what ever we wish with our imagination... &amp; Lego.
      <br><br><h2>Graphic Design</h2>Graphic Design is a class where you explore the all the possibilities that you can do with grahpics, &amp; design. We learn that simple logos such as the <a target="_blank" href"twitter.com/">Twitter</a> logo, aren't so simple. There are multiple hidden meanings behind each and every logo, if they're designed well.
