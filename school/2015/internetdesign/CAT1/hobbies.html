      <br>In my spare time I like to do many things... I keep up with my TV shows, make and code pointless things &amp; eat some pizza... Everyone loves Pizza.
      <br><br>Most of the things I make &amp; code are put on my <a href="http://benandy.github.io/github" target="_blank">GitHub page</a>... A lot of things on this are still being worked on and are no where near comeplete. My current <a target="_blank" href="http://benandy.github.io">website</a> (As of date) is under heavy development, I have no idea when it will be anywhere near complete.
      <br><br>I also enjoy sleeping... As does everyone. Although I like my sleep I still stay up to about 3AM, and wake up at roughly mid-day. My sleep schedual is not the best.
