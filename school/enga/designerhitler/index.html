      Is Designer Baby Like Hitler's Aryan &quot;Master&quot; Race?<br><br>

      With all of today&rsquo;s current technology you can pretty much do anything, including designing your own baby, but is this like Hitler and his Aryan &quot;Master&quot; race?
      <br><br>Designer baby is like Hitler&rsquo;s Aryan &quot;Master&quot; race. Hitler wanted a perfect race, if people want the &quot;perfect&quot; baby they can end up wiping out the imperfections. Hitler wanted everyone with blue eyes and blonde hair, otherwise you were executed. If parents for some reason want everyone with blue eyes and blonde hair, this can easily happen. Hitler&rsquo;s plan was to create a master race.
      <br><br>The Aryan &quot;Master&quot; race were people who had blonde hair and blue eyes, others were considered outsiders. There were posters hung around Germany and other places showing and explaining the Aryan &quot;Master&quot; race. Newspapers had &quot;advertisements&quot; for the Aryan &quot;Master&quot; race, written in Germen showing a young Aryan girl or boy being happy. Much like Hitler&rsquo;s Aryan race, designer baby has some small advertisements explaining to mothers that they can choose their child&rsquo;s appearance.
      <br><br>Designer baby can wipe out certain genes and imperfections in children and babies. With designer baby you can choose things like the baby&rsquo;s hair colour and sexuality. If people are against gays they can easily be wiped out, as red heads or blondes can become more popular. Designer baby could just be the beginning of a &quot;perfect&quot; human race, much like Hitler was attempting to create.
      <br><br>Yes, designer baby is a very cool idea, but it is wrong. It&rsquo;s almost as if people are buying Hitler&rsquo;s ideas and using them on their own children. Certain aspects can be wiped out from the human race; Earth will not be the same with another Hitler. Designer baby is wrong.
